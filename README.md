# 🌿 Willow-Arch

<img width="1394" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aeefd39-7bf4-4f7a-9d78-b6c9a416bb29" />

Willow-Arch is a personal Arch Linux installation script designed to create the base system used by my Hyprland + Quickshell desktop environment.

It is not a general-purpose Arch installer yet.  
It is currently a personal, opinionated installation flow with an interactive terminal UI, full-disk encryption, Btrfs subvolumes, Snapper, GRUB, and a small set of base packages.

> ⚠️ This script partitions and formats disks. Read the code before running it.

Known limitations:
- There is no dry-run mode yet.
- There is no persistent install log yet.

---

## What It Installs

Willow-Arch sets up a minimal Arch system with:

- UEFI boot
- GPT partitioning
- LUKS encryption
- Btrfs filesystem
- Btrfs subvolumes
- Optional swapfile
- Snapper snapshots
- GRUB encrypted boot
- Reflector
- NetworkManager
- Bluetooth
- zram
- Optional AUR helper installation

The installed package set is defined in:
```txt
config/packages/base.txt
```

## Btrfs Layout

The installer creates a LUKS container and formats it as Btrfs.

Current subvolume layout:
```txt
/
├── @            -> /
├── @home        -> /home
├── @root        -> /root
├── @srv         -> /srv
├── @var_log     -> /var/log
├── @snapshots   -> /.snapshots
└── @swap        -> /.swap        # only when swap is enabled
```

Mount options currently used:
```txt
ssd,noatime,compress-force=zstd:3,discard=async
```
